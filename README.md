# 100DaysOfSwiftUI
My progress through Paul Hudsons 100 Days Of SwiftUI code along.

## 01Project_WeSplit - A bill splitter calculator

Objects: `View, NavigationView, Text, TextField, Forms, Group, Sections, Picker`

#### Concepts: 
* "View can only managed up to 10 child views. In order to bypass, use `Group` "
* "Use `@State` when also writing to a variable. `$varname` is used when variable value will be changed. 2 Way Binding"
